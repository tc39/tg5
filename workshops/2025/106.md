## Abstracts

### Updates on the MessageFormat study (Shun Kashiwa, University of California San Diego)

Internationalization and localization are critical for making software accessible to global audiences,
yet their implementation often poses challenges due to linguistic diversity and complexity.
MessageFormat 2 (MF2), a successor to MessageFormat 1.0, aims to overcome these challenges by offering
enhanced expressivity and usability. This study evaluates MF2’s usability and effectiveness through a think-aloud
user study with software engineers and translators. Ten participants were tasked with comprehension, writing,
and translation tasks using MF2. The results reveal that MF2’s syntax is generally approachable for both software
engineers and translators, though the two groups provided distinct feedback. Software engineers reported limitations
in MF2’s expressivity and spent time navigating its functions and parameters to compose messages. Translators,
on the other hand, found the `.match` syntax challenging but faced no diﬀiculty translating existing MF2 messages.
In addition, MF2 exhibited shortcomings in handling certain locale-specific linguistic rules, such as Turkish suﬀixes
and Danish ordinal forms. Overall, our findings suggest that MF2 holds promise as a standard framework for defining
translatable messages. Expansion of the default function registry, comprehensive documentation, and the development
of supporting tools such as GUI editors can foster its broader adoption.

### Formalizing JS decimal numbers with the Lean proof assistant (Jesse Alama, Igalia)

IEEE 754 is a specification for both floating-point numbers and arithmetic,
both in decimal and binary notation, the latter being the more commonly understood part.
As part of the [effort](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decimal/) to add decimal numbers to JavaScript,
based on IEEE 754, we are using the [Lean proof assistant](https://lean-lang.org/) to help make sure that we are getting the details just right.
Although formalization is not a requirement for advancing through the Ecma TC39 stage process,
in some cases it might be helpful for the standards author. In the case of the decimal proposal,
the nature of the data -- numbers -- is fundamental enough, and some details of IEEE 754 unexpected enough,
that formalization may be warranted to help make sure we're getting everything right.
