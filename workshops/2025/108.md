## Abstracts

### Declarative Programming versus Declarative Problem Solving (P. Cabalar)

Declarative programming ideally follows the principle of describing the task to be achieved ("what" to do)
rather than the sequence of steps to achieve that task ("how" to do it). Yet, declarative programming
languages must allow implementing algorithms, that are nothing else but sequences of steps (formally,
Turing machines). So a declarative program is also a computational model normally depending on some
implicit control strategy of the language interpreter that may affect to computational complexity or
even termination. In Logic Programming (LP), for instance, this was summarized by the well-known informal
equation "Algorithms = Logic + Control" stated by Robert A. Kowalski. Declarative Problem Solving goes one
step forward: it consists in finding solutions to computational problems by exclusively using a formal
specification of the relevant domain knowledge and the conditions imposed by the problem to be solved.
Solutions are then computed by generic solvers rather than by specific, problem oriented algorithms that
describe the steps to follow. This approach is applied to different types of computational problems, such
as combinatorial, optimization, numerical constraints, planning, scheduling or temporal constraints. In
the talk, we will discuss some important differences of Declarative Problem Solving with respect to
Declarative Programming, using the LP paradigm of Answer Set Programming as an illustration. 

### Polyhedral optimization and sparse computations (G. Rodríguez)

Sparse data structures are commonly used in many real-world computations for efficiently representing
datasets with a high volume of zero values. Sparse structures are widely used in areas like physics
simulations, graph processing, and machine learning. Storing (and computing with) only the nonzero
elements in the structure saves both memory and computation time.
Traditional sparse formats, like Compressed Sparse Row (CSR), are based on the (possibly compressed)
enumeration of nonzero positions through arrays of coordinates. This allows to write generic executors
that implement computational kernels for arbitrary sparse structures, but increases the memory footprint
of the computation and obfuscates computation structure, complexifying compiler optimizations, e.g.,
vectorization.
This presentation introduces polyhedral optimization, a powerful mathematical framework traditionally used
by compilers to optimize dense loop nests. We will explore how the polyhedral abstractions can be used to
represent sparse computations, optimizing the computation footprint and exposing computation structure to
the optimizer.

### The GLEAMming bridge between JavaScript and the BEAM (L. M. Castro)

Gleam is a new language for Erlang's BEAM virtual machine that brings in a robust type system,
something long awaited by part of the BEAM community. Gleam maintains the expressiveness of functional
programming and profits from the highly concurrent fault-tolerant Erlang runtime.
The design of the language is very concise, so it features no null values, no exceptions,
simple error messages. And on top of it all, JavaScript is supported as a compile target,
so Gleam code can be run in a browser or any other JS-enabled runtime.
During this session, we will quickly (1) go over the history of the BEAM and the recent explosion
of new languages for this platform, helping the growth of the community in different directions;
(2) learn the basics about Gleam.
