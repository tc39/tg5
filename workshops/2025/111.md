## Abstracts

### Integrating Static Optimization and Dynamic Nature in JavaScript (T. Saito)

The class definitions and class field declarations in the ECMAScript standard suggest that the JavaScript engines could be optimized
like class-based static languages. This paper focuses on two well-known optimizations. One is method specialization, using fixed
offsets to access properties. The other is prior hidden class construction, which involves creating runtime class-like structures
called hidden classes before creating instances of the classes. However, implementing such optimizations into JavaScript faces difficulties
because of its dynamic features. We point out three difficulties that must be overcome and propose reasonable solutions. We implemented these
optimizations and solutions in QuickJS, a small, practical JavaScript engine, and obtained promising results.

### Towards Understanding Trends and Patterns in JavaScript Language Feature Usages and Monorepo Refactoring (D. Chen)

JavaScript and its ecosystem offer a wide range of language features, providing developers with flexible ways of
writing and managing their code bases. This talk is two-folded. Firstly, we present an empirical study (accepted by ICSE 2026)
that scanned a large number of open-source JavaScript repositories to find out trends and patterns regarding how developers
use various language features. Then, we present our on-going work that fill the gap of quantifying and understanding the
refactoring and continuous evolution of JavaScript Monorepo, a relatively new repository management paradigm.

### Representation of Numerics (S. Carr)

JavaScript lacks the ability to represent exact decimal values, and we believe that this is a pain point for developers.
The [Amount proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-amount) adds the ability to represent such values, but without the ability to perform arithmetic.
We wish to investigate the uses cases that would be served and whether they are solved by the [Decimal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decimal)
and/or Amount proposals.
