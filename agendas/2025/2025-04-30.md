## Abstracts

### Categorizing TC39 Proposals & Observations from Proposal Statistics

We analyzed 257 proposals by TC39 during the period 2014-2025. We propose a classification system consisting of seven categories:
_API proposal_, _Syntactic proposal_, _Semantic proposal_, _Syntactic + Semantic_, _Syntactic + API_, _Semantic + API_, _Syntactic + Semantic + API_.
In addition, we present statistical insights into the proposal process, including metrics such as speed of evolution, and evolution
trends across topics and categories.
