## Abstracts

### Exploring JavaScript Regular Expressions: matching algorithms, mechanized semantics, and formal verification

We present our on-going study of JavaScript regexes. JavaScript regex semantics differ in subtle ways from other modern regex
languages, and we show that these differences have an impact on some matching algorithms and their complexity.
Thanks to these differences, we even present the first linear-time algorithm to support unrestricted lookarounds.
Then, to enable formal reasoning about JavaScript regexes, we present a full translation of the ECMAScript regex chapter in the proof assistant
Rocq/Coq. On top of the mechanization, we present our formal verification work:
verifying properties of the standard, verifying a linear-time matching algorithm, and reasoning about regex equivalence.
Combined, our contributions lay the foundations for the development of a formally verified, linear-time, expressive JavaScript regex engine.
