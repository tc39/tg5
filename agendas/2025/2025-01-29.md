## Abstracts

### An Interactive Decision-Making Framework for Programming Language Design

When proposing changes to programming languages, keeping track of all decisions and concerns related to
them can become a difficult task. This is especially true for more established languages and larger proposals.
We developed a method for expressing design alternatives and their corresponding concerns: a tailored domain-specific
language allows visualizing and experimenting with designs in an interactive manner. To build on this, we introduced an
automated method for decision-making based on severity assignments for all concerns given by the user. This was achieved by
translating the model into a binary linear programming problem and solving it with the SCIP optimizer. As a case study, we
used our toolset to investigate the design space of one of the ECMAScript language proposals.
