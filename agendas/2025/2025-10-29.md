## Abstracts

### Evolving modules with confidence

Modules are one of the most complex parts of the specification, and they have been changing a lot in the past few years.
Due to the recursive nature of module graph algorithm with mutable state, it's difficult to properly test all possible execution
paths, and it's difficult to properly understand the observable implications of changes to those algorithms. This has caused bugs,
both in browsers and in the specification itself, where some optimization or "editorial" change accidentally caused observable
differences, that have not been caught for years. How can we confidently make evolve modules, without risking more regressions?
