## Abstracts

### Comparison of the standardization processes of ECMAScript, HTML, and CSS

The presentation summarizes a bachelor's thesis analyzing the key similarities and differences in how ECMAScript,
HTML, and CSS are standardized, highlighting the organizations behind each process, the different standardization processes,
and the ways individuals can participate in the standardization work. The presentation objectively compares the different
standardization approaches without evaluating their effectiveness relative to one another, providing a foundation for
further discussion on the next research questions stemming from the thesis.
